# Workload Distribution

The workload was evenly distributed between us. We took a pair programming approach to the code, with Darius typing while we each came up with implementation ideas for what was required. Cameron took hold of writing the README for the program, with Darius giving edits as necessary. Darius took care of posting the screenshots with their appropriate explanations. The grammar writing and parse tree were split evenly.

# How To Run the Program
The program contains the necessary Python library imports for the program. All that is needed to run the program is to load the .py file in your preferred IDE (VSCode, Codeblocks, replit.com, etc), compile, and run.
