# ProgLangProject
Final project for Organization of Programming Languages created by Cameron Todd and Darius Faison.

# Workload Distribution

The workload was evenly distributed between us. We took a pair programming approach to the code, with Darius typing while we each came up with implementation ideas for what was required. Cameron took hold of writing the README for the program, with Darius giving edits as necessary. Darius took care of posting the screenshots with their appropriate explanations. The grammar writing and parse tree were done by Cameron.

# How To Run the Program
The program contains the necessary Python library imports for the program. All that is needed to run the program is to load the .py file in your preferred IDE (VSCode, Codeblocks, replit.com, etc), compile, and run. However, to run the program again, you have to reload it as it is a single-use program.

-    A standard example of a quadratic equation
-    Uses subtraction instead of addition
-    Uses non-typical variable of *q* (any single character [a-z][A-Z] is valid as a variable
-    Successfully parsed and solved

-    A standard example of a polynomial
-    Is not a quadratic function due to the factor 2 term being raised to the -2
-    Syntactic error, therefore unsuccessfully parsed

-    A standard example of a multivariable polynomial equation
-    Is not a quadratic function due to the existence of more than one variable
-    Syntactic error, therefore unsuccessfully parsed

-    An example of an unsimplified quadratic equation
-    Syntactically valid
-    Like terms combined
-    Successfully parsed and solved

-    A standard example of a quadratic equation
-    An excessive amount of spaces added to no detriment to the parser
-    Successfully parsed and solved
